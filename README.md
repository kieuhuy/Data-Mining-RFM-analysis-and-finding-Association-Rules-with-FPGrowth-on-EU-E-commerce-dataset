# Data-Mining: RFM analysis and finding Association Rules with FPGrowth on EU E-commerce dataset
Data mining is a powerful new technique that can help businesses focus on the most critical information in the data they have gathered about their customers and potential customers' behavior. It uncovers information in the data that queries, and reports cannot expose. There are many applications of data mining techniques in daily life but one of the vital is in market basket analysis. This is a data mining technique used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, to reveal product groupings, as well as products that are likely to be bought together. Using the k-means and FP-growth approaches, this project will create a data mining framework to handle an EU e-commercial dataset to cluster the customer and discover the frequent itemset.
